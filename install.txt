Building and installing Frets on Fire
-------------------------------------

Running the game
----------------

First, the following supporting Python libraries should be installed.

	- Python 2.4 or later
	- PyGame
	- PyOpenGL and a video card with recent OpenGL drivers
	- Python Imaging Library
	- numpy
	- Optional: psyco specializing compiler

After this, the game can be started by running the src/FretsOnFire.py file. For
example, in Linux and Mac OS X this can be done from the terminal with the
following commands:

	$ cd src
	$ python FretsOnFire.py

Making an installation package
------------------------------

A redistributable installation package for the game can be created as follows.

For Windows:

	1. Install Nullsoft's NSIS installation system.
           Note: Frets on Fire assumes that the NSIS tool can be found at 
           c:/Program Files/NSIS/makeNSIS.exe. This can be overridden by 
           passing the parameter MAKENSIS=<path to makeNSIS.exe> to make in
           the following step.

	2. Install GNU make.

	3. Run the following command

		$ make dist

For Mac OS X:

	1. Install py2app.

	2. Run the following command

		$ make dist

Additionally, a generic source distribution package can be created by typing

	$ make sdist
